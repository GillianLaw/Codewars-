# Codewars-
I've been playing with katas for a few months now. Foolishly, I never thought of it as a way to show my skills and so I often didn't save the code - I just entered it on the site and was pleased if it passed. So - here are a few examples, and you can see my profile here: https://www.codewars.com/users/GALaw

Codewars has been great for something fun to do to practice coding and I've reached 5ku
